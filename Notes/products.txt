to remove background of an image use,

to convert webp to png 

https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png


start by making the props 

first create an object 
const products = [
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones}]

call a component called product which we haven't made yet 
 <Product />
make the component Product inside the components folder 


inside Products.jsx, map the object  and pass the object to the <Product /> i.e 
{products.map((product) => ( 
    <Product 
        title={product.title} image={product.image}/> 
))}

then duplicate the object values to add more stuff 
const Products = () => {
    const products = [
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
    ]


so it becomes 

const Products = () => {
    const products = [
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
    ]
  return <div className=" bg-[#eaeded] h-screen">
    {products.map((product) => ( 
    <Product 
        title={product.title} image={product.image}/> 
    ))}


and now we have our props 
we can access our props inside the Product.jsx file

pass them 
const Product = ({title, image}) => {

<div>{title}</div>

also pass in the image 

<div>
        {title}
        <img src = {image} />
    </div>




in Products.jsx it looks like this 

import React from 'react';
import headphones from '../assets/headphones.png';
import laptops from '../assets/laptop.png';
import phone from '../assets/phone.png';
import Product from './Product';

const Products = () => {
    const products = [
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Laptop",  image:laptops},
        {title:"Phone",  image:phone},
        {title:"Headphones",  image:headphones},
        {title:"Laptop",  image:laptops},
        {title:"Phone",  image:phone},
    ]
  return <div className=" bg-[#eaeded] h-screen">
    {products.map((product) => ( 
    <Product 
        title={product.title} image={product.image}/> 
    ))}


  </div>
  
}


in Product.jsx it looks like this 

import React from 'react'

const Product = ({title, image}) => {
  return (
    <div>
        {title}
        <img src = {image} />
    </div>
  )
}


Now lets use them as a card

we'll style inside Product.jsx
